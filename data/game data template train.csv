"<s>[INST] You are given notations of chess board positions and the next chess move. Explain why it is the best move.     ### Chess board positions: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1 ### Next Move: 1 e4 ### Explanation: [/INST] This is an excellent opening move. White anchors a pawn in the centre of the board and opens lines for his queen and a bishop. His next move, if he is allowed, will be 2 d4. The two pawns will then control four squares on the fifth rank, c5, d5, e5 and f5, and prevent Black from placing any of his pieces on those important squares.
How shall Black reply to White’s first move? He must not waste time considering meaningless moves, such as l ...h6 or l ...a6. These and other aimless moves do nothing toward developing the pieces, nor do they interfere with White’s threat to monopolize the centre. Black must fight for an equal share of the good squares. Black must dispute possession of the centre. Why all this stress on the centre? Why is it so important? Pieces placed in the centre enjoy the greatest freedom of action and have the widest scope for their attacking powers. A knight, for example, posted in the centre, reaches out in eight directions and attacks eight squares. Standing at the side of the board, its range of attack is limited to four squares. It is only half a knight! Occupation of the centre means control of the most valuable territory. It leaves less room for the enemy’s pieces, and makes defence difficult, as his pieces tend to get in each other’s way. Occupation of the centre, or control of it from a distance, sets up a barrier that divides the opponent’s forces and prevents them from cooperating harmoniously. Resistance by an army thus disunited is usually not very effective. </s>"

"<s>[INST] You are given notations of chess board positions and the next chess move. Explain why it is the best move.     ### Chess board positions: rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2 ### Next Move: 2 Nf3 ### Explanation: [/INST] Absolutely the best move on the board! The knight develops with a threat – attack on a pawn. This gains time as Black is not free to develop as he pleases. He must save the pawn before he does anything else, and this cuts down his choice of reply.
The knight develops towards the centre, which increases the scope of his attack.
The knight exerts pressure on two of the strategically important squares in the centre, e5 and d4. The knight comes into play early in the game, in compliance with the precept: develop knights before bishops! One reason for the cogency of this principle is that the knight takes shorter steps than the bishop. It takes longer for him to get to the fighting area. The bishop can sweep the length of the chessboard in one move (notice how the f1-bishop can reach all the way to a6). Where the knight takes a hop, skip and jump to get to b5, the bishop makes it in one leap.
Another purpose in developing the knights first is that we are fairly sure where they belong in the opening. We know that they are most effective on certain squares. We are not always certain of the right spot for the bishop. We may want the bishop to command a long diagonal, or we may prefer to have it pin an enemy piece. So: bring out your knights before developing the bishops!
At this point you will note that Black must defend his e-pawn before going about his business. There are several ways to protect the pawn. He must evaluate and choose from these possibilities: 2...f6; 2...Qf6; 2...Qe7; 2...Bd6; 2...d6; and 2...Nc6. How does Black decide on the right move? Must he analyse countless combinations and try to visualize every sort of attack and defence for the next ten or fifteen moves?
Let me hasten to assure you that a master does not waste valuable time on futile speculation. Instead, he makes use of a potent secret weapon – positional judgement. Applying it enables him to eliminate from consideration inferior moves, to which the average player devotes much thought. He hardly glances at moves that are obviously violations of principle! </s>"

He follows the advice of the Frenchman who said,""Sortez les pieces!"". He brings a piece out and saves the e-pawn without any loss of time.
I would caution you that this and other maxims are not to be blindly followed. In chess, as in life, rules must often be swept aside. In general, though, the principles governing sound chess play do make wonderful guideposts, especially in the opening, the middlegame and the ending! </s>"

The bishop seizes a valuable diagonal in the centre and attacks Black's f7- pawn. This pawn is particularly vulnerable as it is guarded by one piece only - the king. It is not unusual, even early in the game, to sacrifice a piece for this pawn, so that the king in capturing it is uprooted, driven into the open and exposed to a violent attack. </s>"

Let us look at the alternatives:
3...Bb4: Inferior, because Black’s bishop takes no part in the struggle for control of the centre and has little scope here.
3...Bd6: Poor, since the d-pawn is blocked, and the other bishop may have trouble coming out.
3...Be7: Not too bad, because the bishop looks out on two diagonals and is well placed for defence. At e7 the bishop has made only one step forward, but it has been developed once it has left the back rank. The important thing to remember is that every piece must be put in motion.
The strongest developing move is 3...Bc5. On this excellent square the bishop commands an important diagonal, exerts pressure on the centre and attacks a weak pawn. This deployment conforms to two golden rules for opening play:
Place each piece as quickly as possible on the square where it is most effective.
Move each piece only once in the opening. </s>"

After 5 d4, attacking bishop and pawn, Black must reply 5...exd4. The recapture by 6 cxd4 leaves White with two pawns in control of the centre.
His secondary aim is to bring the queen to b3, intensifying the pressure on the f7-pawn.
These are its virtues, but there are drawbacks to 4 c3: In the opening, pieces not pawns should be moved.
In advancing to c3, the pawn occupies a square that should be reserved for the b1-knight. </s>"

Black develops a piece while parrying the threat. If White persists in playing 5 d4, the continuation 5...exd4 6 cxd4 Qxe4+ wins a pawn.

This would leave White with an impressive line-up in the centre, while the c3-square is then available for his knight.

Now that his e-pawn is secure, the bishop simply retreats, still bearing down on the white centre from its new position.
Despite its formidable appearance, White’s pawn-centre is shaky. The d- pawn is attacked three times, and White must keep a triple guard on it while trying to complete his development. On 7 Qb3, which he contemplated earlier, the queen’s protection is removed, while on 7 Nbd2 it is cut off. Meanwhile White is faced with the threat of 7...Bg4 pinning and thereby rendering useless one of the pawn’s supports.
Before committing himself to a definite course of action, White sets a little trap: </s>"

White threatens an attack on the bishop by 8 a5. If then 8....Bxa5, 9 d5 strikes at the knight protecting the bishop. After the reply 9...d8, White captures by 10 Rxa5, winning a piece.

But what right has White to play combinations when his development is so backward? An attack such as he initiates here is premature and should not succeed.

 ### Explanation: [/INST] A coffee-house move! Weak players make this move instinctively in dire dread of having a piece pinned.
It is better to submit to the pin – a temporary inconvenience – than to prevent it by a move that loosens the position of the pawns defending the king and weakens the structure permanently. Playing h3 or g3 after castling creates an organic weakness that can never be remedied, as a pawn once advanced cannot retreat, and the position, once altered, cannot be restored. The pawn that has moved forward itself becomes a target for direct attack, while the square it guarded earlier (here it is g3) becomes a landing field for the enemy’s troops. “You should never, unless of necessity or to gain an advantage, move the pawns in front of the castled king,” says Tarrasch, “for each pawn move loosens the position.”

Alekhine expresses it even more strongly: “Always try to keep the three pawns in front of your castled king on their original squares as long as possible.”
Black can now speculate on breaking up White’s kingside by removing the h3-pawn, even at the cost of a piece. The recapture tears open the g-file and exposes White’s king to attack. This plan is of course not to be put into action until more pieces are brought into play. </s>"

But Black is not interested in grabbing pawns. His positional superiority is great enough to justify looking for a combination that will conclusively force a win. His bishops exert terrific pressure on their respective diagonals (even though one bishop is still undeveloped!). Each of them attacks a pawn shielding the king. Black’s queen is ready to swing over to the kingside, while the knight can leap in if more help is needed. Black controls the centre, a condition that, Capablanca says, is essential for a successful attack against the king. In short, Black is entitled to a winning combination as reward for his methodical positional play. </s>"

In disturbing the position of the pawns shielding his king, White weakens organically the structure of the kingside castled position and sets up the unfortunate h-pawn itself as a convenient target for direct attack.
All chess theorists affirm the validity of the concept of leaving the kingside pawns unmoved, from Staunton, who said more than a hundred and forty years ago, ""It is seldom prudent in an inexperienced player to advance the pawns on the side on which his king has castled,"" to Reuben Fine, who said a century later, ""The most essential consideration is that the king must not be subject to attack. He is safest when the three pawns are on their original squares.""                        </s>"

What is the justification for Black’s advance of the h-pawn?
Black has not weakened his defensive position, since his king is not castled on the kingside. His advance of the h-pawn is a gesture of attack, not a timid attempt to ward off a pin. The h-pawn will constitute a base for the g-pawn, which will march up to g5 and then g4. From there it will strike in two directions, at White’s knight and his h3-pawn. White will be compelled either to capture this pawn or let it capture his own h3-pawn. No matter which exchange occurs, it results in an opening up of the g-file, along which Black can align his pieces for an attack on the king. </s>"

In this game, White is adopting a system that calls for a storing up of dynamic energy behind the lines, which is released at the right time by an explosion at the key e4-square.
To this end, White develops so that his pieces exert their maximum pressure at e4. His bishop will therefore occupy d3, and his b1-knight will move to d2. If more concentration of force is needed, his queen will supply it by developing at e2, or he may play O-O followed by Re1. Then, with all this potential energy ready to let loose, the e-pawn advances to e4, to rip the position apart and open fire on Black's kingside. 
Development in the Colle System is on positional lines, but the objective is a kingside attack! </s>"

Clearly, it was better strategy either to attack White’s pawn-centre by 3 ...c5 or to counter by 3 ...Bf5. Not only is this latter a simple, sound developing move, but also it prepares to oppose White’s bishop, which is headed for d3, with an equal force.

Why an exclamation mark for a simple threat which is so easily countered? Why glorify this move when Black can not only save the pawn but also cause White to lose time? Black simply moves the h-pawn one square, rescues the pawn, and forces White’s knight to retreat.
The answer to these questions is that White’s purpose with his brilliant knight move is to compel one of the pawns defending the king to step forward.
The secret of conducting a successful kingside attack is to create a breach in the cordon of pawns surrounding the enemy king; to induce or force one of the pawns to move. The change in the line-up of pawns fixes the defence with a permanent weakness. </s>"

Explain why it is the best move.     ### Chess board positions: r2q1rk1/pb3pp1/2n1pb1p/1p4N1/2pPQ3/2P5/PPB2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 1 14 ### Next Move: 14 ...g6 ### Explanation: [/INST] Making room for the king’s escape by 14 ...Re8 does not look inviting, as after 15 Qh7+ Kf8 16 Ne4 White’s attack appears dangerous. However, it is preferable to Black’s actual move, which stops the queen coming any closer, but alters the pawn configuration. This change in the pawn formation saddles Black with a weakness that is organic, and one that can turn out to be fatal.
All this is encouraging to White, but how does he proceed? How does he exploit the weaknesses in Black’s position? Above all, what does he do about his knight which is still under attack? Shall it retreat abjectly?
Before moving the knight back to f3 mechanically and unthinkingly, White looks carefully at the situation. The opportunity to strike a decisive blow may be here at this very moment, but one hasty ‘obvious move’ may give Black just enough breathing time to reorganize his defences.
This is the position, and here is how White reasons out his attack:                                                                                     The key point must be Black’s g-pawn, which guards his king from invasion. If anything happens to this pawn – if it is captured – the defence crumbles, and I can break into the fortress. How do I go about removing it from the board?
The g-pawn is protected by the f-pawn; suppose I destroy its support by sacrificing my knight for the f-pawn? After 15 Nxf7 Kxf7 (or 15 ...Rxf7) 16 Qxg6+, and I have two pawns for my knight, with a third one in sight, as the
h-pawn must fall. Material is then approximately even, but his position is
completely broken up, and clinching the win should be easy.
This might be the general plan, but before putting it in motion, White analyses the combination for possible flaws and comes up with this: after 15 Nxf7 Rxf7 (bringing another piece to the defence) 16 Qxg6+ Rg7 17 Qxh6 Nxd4!, suddenly Black is the aggressor! He threatens mate in two by 18 ...Ne2+ 19 Kh1 Bxg2#, as well as outright ruin by 18...Rxg2+, followed by a deadly discovered check.
Clearly this line of play is too dangerous. Is there another way to break through, without letting Black’s rook come into the game? Can I get rid of the f-pawn without disturbing the rook? It is important that I remove this pawn, as it supports the g-pawn and the e-pawn. Wait a minute! There is a clue in the last sentence. The f-pawn, guarding two other pawns, is serving two masters. Obviously it is overworked! I must add to its burden by luring it away from its present important post! </s>"

3)He wastes time capturing a pawn which he cannot retain.
4)He permits White to seize the centre next move, which forces a retreat by his bishop and a consequent loss of time.

One drawback for White in the advance of his e-pawn is that the occupation of e5 by a pawn deprives his pieces of a useful square. The knight especially operates to great advantage when posted at e5.
In compensation, the pawn exercises a cramping effect on Black’s entire position and imposes particular restraint on Black’s king’s knight, which cannot develop naturally at f6. </s>"

White, who is interested only in completing his development, has not the slightest intention of making either of these moves.
The move ...h6 by Black (or h3 by White) should be played only if the h- pawn is to form a base for an attack by pawns, i.e. if it supports an advance by the g-pawn. Defensively, the move does more harm than good, as it
loosens the pawn structure and weakens its resistance to attack. It is especially dangerous if the king has castled on the kingside, as the pawn itself, standing out from the ranks, provides a convenient target. Also (as if the foregoing were not enough) it does nothing to further the cause of development and wastes time which should be devoted to the liberation of pieces which are still shut in. </s>"

What is the rook’s future on this file? It attacks a pawn, but the pawn is easily protected. Why not try for a kingside attack, instead of this futile demonstration?
The answer lies in this: the master’s instinct (or perhaps his knowledge or experience) tells him that he must seize any files that are open – control them at once with his rooks or his queen. “Make the moves,” it says, “that conform with the requirements of the position, and you will be suitably rewarded. Play the moves necessary to establish a superior position! Develop your pieces so that they enjoy maximum mobility, and control most of the territory. Direct your efforts to weakening the enemy position, cramping the movements of his pieces, and reducing the capacity of his resistance before you make the first move of a combination.

How easy it is to advance the pawn, safeguard it from attack, and let the rook bite on granite! Obvious as this defence is, no top-ranking player would rush to adopt it! He would try to avoid disturbing the pawn formation and consider instead such alternatives as 11 ...Rb8 or 11 ...Qc8.
After the actual move, the light squares on Black’s queenside have been weakened. More to the point, the advance of the pawn deprives the c6-knight of solid support – a circumstance that White will exploit in his forthcoming attack on the king, away over at the other side of the board. </s>"

Before making a move that suggests itself so readily, Black might have asked himself, ""How can I exploit White’s one weakness, the doubled pawns on the c-file?""
He might then have hit upon 12...Na5, with the object of swinging the knight to c4. There it blockades the doubled pawn, interferes with the free movement of White’s pieces, and in general sticks like a bone in the throat. White could capture the knight, but then he parts with one of his valuable bishops, and as a result of the exchange his pawn position would be inferior to Black's. Finally, Black could then anchor one of his pieces to great effect on d5, a square from which it could never be evicted by pawns. </s>"

3)He has ripped away the screen of pawns that sheltered Black’s king.

Against the passive 2 Nc3, which develops a piece but attacks nothing, Black can choose from among such good responses as 2 ...Nf6, 2 ...Nc6 and 2 ...Bc5.

It attacks a pawn which is peculiarly vulnerable as it is defended only by the king.
This does not mean that White will capture the pawn in the next few moves, but the threat is always there. Many a short brilliancy owes its life to similar captures in which the bishop is sacrificed simply to draw the king out into the open where White’s other pieces can get at him. </s>"

In the opening, a bishop is best placed for attack when it controls a diagonal passing through the centre or when it pins a hostile knight and renders it immobile.

Castling early in the game is generally sound strategy. In this case it is inappropriate, as White’s centre is formidable and must be destroyed. Black must play 7 ...Nxe4, accepting the offer of a pawn, and take his chances of surviving whatever attack might follow. It cannot be worse than this passive castling, which results in both his knights being evicted from their fine posts. Pillsbury gave as his rule, which he said was absolute and vital: “Castle because you want to or because you must, but not because you can.”

 The knight develops in one move to its most suitable square in the opening.
 It exerts pressure on two of the four squares in the vital central area.  It comes in toward the centre so that it enjoys maximum mobility.
 It helps clear the kingside, enabling early castling of the king on that side.
 It is posted ideally for the defence of the king after he castles.
 It comes into play with a gain of time – an attack on a pawn! In short, it’s a very good move! </s>"

White gets his pawn back and prevents 5...d6 or 5...d5. After either of these moves, the continuation 6 Nxc6 bxc6 7 Bxc6+ wins the exchange.
White also has a powerful threat in 6 Bxc6 dxc6 7 Qh5+ Ke7 8 Qf7+  Kd6 9 Nc4#.
This is all very tempting, since the possibility of mating so early in the game is attractive to the young player, but such ambition should be suppressed. Premature mating attacks are usually repulsed with loss of time or material to the aggressor.

Yes, if the move is justified by the particular position. Black has four good arguments for the pawn push:
1)He must drive off the bishop before he can advance his d-pawn (otherwise the king is in check).
2)The time lost in moving the pawn is compensated for by the fact that the bishop must also lose a move in retreating.
3)He opens a fine diagonal for his queen.
4)The attack on the bishop will win a pawn, and “A pawn is worth a little trouble,” according to Steinitz. </s>"

Which move is better? Which should you play? The answer is: play the move that you like, the one that best suits your style and temperament. If you are a careful, cautious player who knows the full value of a pawn – that each one is a potential queen, and that the loss of a pawn may be the loss of the game – stick to 4 Bg5 and the openings of positional chess, the Ruy Lopez, the Queen's Pawn openings, the Reti and the English. On the other hand, if you prefer daring, adventurous chess, and a pawn is simply a barrier to the sweeping onrush of an attack by your pieces, play openings which allow scope for your imagination, the Evans, Danish, King's and other gambits. </s>"

It is worth noting that a pinned piece not only is unable to move but is also powerless to capture. It does not protect any other pieces, since it is completely paralysed. Hence it follows that not only is the bishop immobilized and in danger of its life (as it may be attacked again and again) but the knight that depends on it for protection is no longer secure. Briefly, Black is now threatened with loss of a piece by 12 Bxf6. </s>"

Spielmann’s strategy to this point and the decisive combination that follows would have pleased Lasker, who once said, “In the beginning of the game ignore the search for combinations, abstain from violent moves. Aim for small advantages, accumulate them, and only after having attained these ends search for the combination – and then with all the power of will and intellect, because then the combination must exist, however deeply hidden.”  A glance shows that White has achieved the requisite positional superiority. If there is a combination to be evolved, it must be now, before Black has time to reorganize his pieces for defence. Now, while he has five pieces actively in play against two of Black’s. Now, while he has an open file – enough! enough! The combination must be there!
Here is White’s line of reasoning: Black’s advance of the g-pawn has deprived the knight of stable support. It is still guarded by two pieces, but if the bishop were not there it would be defended only once. In fact, if the bishop were not there, the knight would be pinned and subject to an enduring attack. The bishop appears in both equations. Obviously the bishop is the culprit, and it must be destroyed! And at once, before Black has time for 12 ...Be6! </s>"

Apparently there isn’t, as in order to strike at it with the h-pawn, he must move the rook out of the way, and then play h4 and h5, a process which takes time and achieves little.
What other line is there? Sacrifice a piece for the g-pawn? Obviously this is useless, as White still does not break through.
But the pawn did advance, and there is a weakness somewhere. We know this fact to be true, and in this fact there must be the clue to the winning combination.
The pawn’s advance weakened the squares h6 and f6, as they are no longer guarded by the pawn. This means that White must try to get control of these squares, either seize and occupy them with his pieces, or use them as a means of penetrating into the enemy camp.
But wait! Doesn’t Black’s knight still guard the f6-square? Indeed it does, and this knowledge provides us with the information we need. The knight is the guardian of the dark squares, and the knight must be destroyed! </s>"

The reply 2 ...exd4 leads to
3Qxd4 Nc6 4 Qe3 Nf6, when Black has two pieces in play to one of White’s. This amounts to taking the initiative away from White early in the game.

The general plan of mobilization is to establish a pawn in the centre, develop the minor pieces (the knights before bishops, whenever feasible), then castle to get the rooks to the centre files, and finally bring the queen out – but not too far from home. Premature development of the queen is dangerous, as it is subject to annoying attacks by pawns and minor pieces.

The most natural move on the board: White strikes at the defender of the pawn he attacks. It is true that he cannot win the pawn at once, as after 4 Bxc6 dxc6 5 Nxe5 Qd4 Black regains the pawn, but the pressure on Black is constant, and the threat is always in the air.
The Ruy Lopez is probably the strongest of all kingside openings. White has more to say in the centre, since he will be able to play d4 without much trouble, while Black will find it difficult to achieve ...d5.
White’s pieces have more room to move around in, while Black’s game is considerably cramped in many variations. </s>"

The danger in this line is that it leaves Black’s position in the centre somewhat insecure.
The text leads to a more blocked position, difficult to break through, but requires patience on Black’s part. The bishop’s development at e7 is satisfactory even though it has moved only one square away from home. The important thing is that it has left the back rank and facilitated castling.

Both pieces are needed for the protection of the d-pawn and the maintenance of the pawn formation in the centre. An exchange of the white knight by ...Bxf3, and the recapture by the queen, removes at one stroke two supports of the d-pawn.
Is White violating principle in moving one of the pawns near his king? Maybe, but one must know when to slight conventions as well as observe them. In this particular situation it is important to prevent an attack on the knight, its subsequent exchange and the break-up of White’s pawns in the centre. The move of the h-pawn is weakening, but a lesser evil than would result from permitting the pin. But wait a moment! Is it a weakening move if Black is unable to benefit by it? Is it detrimental to the position if Black cannot exploit it by a kingside attack?
The answer is no! A move is weak only if the opponent can turn its imperfections to his advantage. The entire position is strong or weak only in relation to the position of the opponent. In this case, the move of the h-pawn is expedient as it conforms to the requirements of the specific position. </s>"

This ought to be enough to beat down resistance if no quicker win is available.
Note that White has not embarked on dubious long-range combinations. His plan, in most cases aimed at increasing his positional superiority, is made for a few moves only. Don’t believe all those stories you hear of chess masters analysing intricate combinations with dozens of variations for thirty moves ahead. They don’t do this because they don’t have to! It is far easier and more to the point to look only a few moves ahead and try to maintain at least an equal game at every stage. Winning by accumulating small advantages is more consistent with a common-sense approach than to seek to overwhelm the opponent with bewildering combinations and venturesome sacrificial attacks. Strengthening one’s own position gradually while undermining that of the opponent is more important than indulging in fruitless speculative fancies. </s>"

It does more than that.
It frees a square for the king and gives an extra one to the g1-knight. It is true that the knight is best developed at f3, but there are times when it is expedient to bring it to e2 – perhaps to reach f5 by way of g3. It is just as well to add to the knight’s freedom of movement, if no time is lost thereby. As to the king, there’s no harm in letting him have a bit more breathing space too. Many a king has been smothered by a lack of consideration, or by carelessness.

Of this pawn formation, Staunton, in the nineteenth century, said, “It is generally advantageous for your pawns to occupy the middle of the board, because when there they greatly retard the movements of the opposing forces. The e-pawn and the d-pawn at their fourth squares are well posted, but it is not easy to maintain them in that position, and if you are driven to advance one of them, the power of both is much diminished.” </s>"

 He wants to avoid the knight being pinned, as might occur after 3 c3.
 He is prepared, in the event of an attack on his d-pawn by ...c5, to reply c3, supporting the centre. Should pawns be exchanged on d4, he recaptures with the c-pawn and keeps a pawn in the centre.
It is true that his c1-bishop is blocked, but this condition is only temporary.

The idea is that by attacking the e4-pawn, Black aims to force this pawn forward to e5. As Staunton explained above, once White’s two central pawns do not stand abreast, his whole central structure is weakened.
An alternative and equally good plan was to fight for control of the centre by 3...c5, incidentally permitting his queen the use of another diagonal and access to the queenside.

He knows that the pawn may be weaker at e5, but he weighs strengths and weaknesses. At e5 the pawn drives the knight away from its most useful post and sends it off to another square where it interferes with the free movements of Black’s other pieces.

Black’s position is cramped by the chain of enemy pawns on d4 and e5, and he should not allow this situation to persist. He must try to break White’s grip on the centre to obtain more space for his pieces. The correct continuation was 8...cxd4 9 cxd4 f6, virtually forcing 10 exf6 Nxf6. Then the problem with the d7-knight blocking in the c8-bishop has been resolved, and the disappearance of the e5-pawn means that Black has gained the d6-square for the development of his dark- squared bishop. If Black does not take the necessary liberating action, then he is likely to be gradually squeezed to death. Such a fate befell even so great a player as Capablanca in his game with Alekhine at AVRO 1938. As a consequence of his inferior opening play, Capablanca was tied up so badly that he could not stir and that he resigned with nearly all his pieces still on the board. </s>"

The profound purpose of the move is to compel one of the pawns near the king to move forward.
The advance of any pawn around the king loosens the defensive structure and results in a permanent weakening which can be exploited, while the pawn that made the forward step itself often becomes a target for direct attack. </s>"

There is no trick move in the opening that will catch even a fair-to-middling player off- balance.
What you can do is apply order and method in your conduct of this phase, so as to increase your chances of getting a favourable position. All you need do is follow a few simple rules for sound development:
  Begin with 1 e4 or 1 d4, either of which moves releases two pieces.
 Anchor at least one pawn in the centre and give it solid support. Pawns in the centre keep enemy pieces from settling themselves on the best squares.
 Wherever feasible, bring out your knights before the bishops. Broadly speaking, the knights do their best work at f3 and c3 (f6 and c6 when Black), where their power is tremendous for defence as well as offence.
 Of two developing moves, select the more aggressive one. Develop with a threat if you can.
 Move each piece only once in the opening. Place it at once on a square where it has some bearing on the centre and where it has the greatest scope for attack.
 Move at most two pawns in the early stages of the game. Play with the pieces.
 Develop the pieces with a view to controlling the centre, either by occupying it or bearing down on it from a distance, as fianchettoed bishops do.
 Develop the queen, but close to home to avoid her being harassed by pawns and minor pieces.
 Do not chase after pawns at the expense of development.
 Secure the safety of the king by early castling, preferably on the kingside. </s>"

He might fianchetto his bishops, for example, and strike at the centre from a distance, in order to undermine it.

If White does try 10 d4, the response 10 ...Nc4 is hard to meet. If White replies 11 Nxe5, then after 11 ...N6xe5 12 dxe5 Nxe3 13 fxe3 he is left with a rickety column of pawns on the e-file.

White’s best line is probably 10 Na4, in order to swing the knight to c5, a square which White must try to control in this type of English Opening. Otherwise he might continue developing by 10 Rc1 and only then consider the knight manoeuvre.

Unfortunately, moves such as this, dictated more by instinct than reason, have an injurious effect on the castled position, as the structure is loosened.

A simple threat and easy to meet – all Black has to do is play 11 ...g6 or 11 ...h6.
What then is White aiming at?
The hidden purpose is to force Black to move one of the kingside pawns, to avoid being mated. A move by either of these pawns creates a looseness in the defensive structure that can never be repaired. It weakens the position organically as it makes a breach that can never be closed. The pawn that advances can never go back to its former position in the line of defensive pawns. </s>"

White has a choice of various replies:
1)3 exd5, in order to simplify.
2)3 e5, to cramp Black with the pawn chain.
3)3 Nc3 (also 3 Nd2 or, less effectively, 3 Bd3), to protect the pawn and develop a piece at the same time.
The first method was favoured by Morphy, who liked open positions that gave his pieces wide scope for attack. Nowadays it is rarely adopted, as after the exchange of pawns the positions are equal and symmetrical and an attack is difficult to whip up, unless you are a Morphy.
The cramping move 3 e5 has a great many advocates, but the argument against this system is that White’s pawn chain is rigid and susceptible to undermining tactics. Black initiates a strong counterattack on the base of the pawn-chain by 3...c5, followed by ...Nc6 and ...Qb6, when White finds himself defending a centre that has lost its flexibility.
There remains the third way, which is simple and consistent with common sense in chess – to support the e-pawn and bring a piece out on the scene. </s>"

But why give up the knight, which I said a moment ago was occupying a wonderful outpost, for a bishop that seems to have little potential?
There are at least three good reasons:
 The exchange deprives Black of one of his bishops, and the mere possession of both bishops is a formidable attacking weapon, no matter how placid the position.
 The reduction in material increases the dynamic power of White’s pair of bishops, which have more space to work in. The emptier the board, the better they can sweep the area, one operating on light and the other on dark diagonals.
The third reason is rather subtle:
 Black’s kingside position is stoutly defended by the knight, and the knight in turn by the bishop and queen. In order to get at the knight, which must eventually be destroyed for a kingside attack to succeed, White first removes one of its firm supports, the bishop. The substitution of Black’s queen for the bishop will make a pin on the knight a potent one – one which can not easily be shaken off. </s>"

It is stronger than the immediate 12 Nxe7+ and causes Black to modify his plans. Let us analyse both moves:
If White plays 12 Nxe7+, then after 12...Wxe7 13 Wf3 White attacks the rook. The rook evades the queen by escaping to b8, and Black’s next move, 14 ...Bb7, drives the queen off the long diagonal, leaving Black’s bishop in control of it.
After the actual move 12 Wf3, Black is threatened with 13 Nxe7+ Qxe7 14 Qxa8 – loss of a rook. This time the rook cannot run from the queen, as the flight square b8 is covered by White’s knight, and the response 12...Bb7 (to interpose the bishop, meanwhile developing it on the long diagonal) fails after 13 Nxe7+ Qxe7 14 Qxb7, and White wins a piece. </s>"

Before going any further, let’s review the bidding:
By doing nothing more remarkable than making simple developing moves, White has an advantage in his pair of bishops, a better all-around position, more pieces in play, and an enduring initiative.
More pieces in play? Yes, his queen and both bishops are actively posted, while Black’s knight is unable to move, his queen must hover about the knight (or lose a pawn after Bxf6) and his bishop has little mobility, shut off as it is from the kingside by Black’s own e-pawn. The pawn position in the centre also favours White, in that his d-pawn on the fourth rank has more to say about affairs than the enemy pawn at e6.
White now plans to create a breach in the line-up of pawns screening Black’s king, by next playing the surprising but logical 15 Qe4. Black could not reply 15 ...Nxe4 to this, as after 16 Bxe7 (attacking two pieces) 16 ...Re8 17 Bxe4 he has no time to take the e7-bishop as his a8-rook is under attack. The idea underlying 15 Qe4 is not to induce Black to snatch the queen, but by the threat of 16 Bxf6 Qxf6 17 Qxh7# to compel him to play
15 ...g6. The effect of this pawn move would be to loosen the defensive structure shielding the king, remove a prop from under the pinned knight, and offer White points of entry on the weakened dark squares h6 and f6, which are no longer guarded by the g-pawn. One possibility, for example, is 15  Qe4 g6 16 Qh4 (attacking the knight) 16 ...Kg7 17 Bh6+, and White wins the exchange. </s>"

 It prevents any attempt by Black to free himself by prying open the e-
file.
 It makes provision for utilizing the e1-rook in a kingside attack, somewhat like this: 16 Qh3 (again threatening to win by 17 Bxf6) 16 ...h6 17 Bxh6 gxh6 18 Qxh6, and the rook comes in decisively by way of e5 and g5 to inflict mate. </s>"

The pressure is now redoubled on the h-pawn, which White threatens to win either by 17 Bxf6 followed by 18 Qxh7+ or simply by taking it at once with the bishop, as Black’s pinned knight dare not recapture, and his king may not take the bishop.
How does Black defend himself against White’s threats?
If 16 ...h6, then 17 Bxh6 gxh6 18 Qxh6 Qf8 (otherwise 19 Re5 will lead to mate) 19 Qxf6, when White, two pawns up, wins easily.
If 16 ...g6 (saving the h-pawn but depriving the knight of any real support), White wins by 17 Qh4 Kg7 18 Re4!, followed by 19 Rf4, and the rook too hits out at the helpless knight.
If 16 ...e5 (uncovering an attack on the queen), then 17 Bxf6 Bxh3 (or 17 ...Qxf6 18 Qxd7, and White wins a piece) 18 Bxe7 and White is a piece ahead.
Finally, after 16 ...c5 17 Bxh7+ Kf8 18 Be4 (threatening a devastating check at h8) 18...g8, Black is a pawn down and still on the defensive.

If you can play this sort of move (18 Qh6), you are a cut above the average player. Most young players (in a chess sense) have a tendency to try checking the king to death only to find after something like 18 Qxh7+ Kf8 19 Qh8+ Ke7 that the king has escaped and the attack is exhausted.

The obvious threat of mate camouflages the real purpose of this move.
White’s last two moves are those of a beginner – or perhaps of a great master! The knight has moved twice to assist the queen in an attack, which the books say is premature, since White’s development is not complete. Why does Alekhine violate elementary opening principles?
The reason he does so is that routine development (“You get your pieces out quietly and I’ll do the same with mine”) would give Black time to reorganize his position. Black has committed some indiscretions (such as moving one knight five times in the opening!), and the way to punish these lapses is to keep him occupied – face him with problems at every point and give him no time to recover. If it requires unconventional moves to force weaknesses in his position, then play these unorthodox moves! Moves are good or bad by one standard only – their effect on the position at hand. </s>"

Explain why it is the best move.     ### Chess board positions: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1 ### Next Move: 1 d4 ### Explanation: [/INST] One of the merits of beginning a game with 1 d4 is that the pawn standing in the centre is protected. It is safe from attack, whereas in openings starting with 1 e4, the e-pawn is more vulnerable.
In queen’s pawn openings, with the queen firmly backing up the centre pawn, White dictates the tempo. He has the initiative and keeps it for a long time against any defence, any line of play that Black may select. Right from the start, White is given the opportunity to build up his position, with little danger of being bothered by a counterattack, while Black struggles to achieve equality. If Black plays timidly – if he fails to dispute the centre by ...c5 at some stage – his queenside pieces, especially the c8-bishop, will be badly cramped and unable to develop decent activity. If he develops carelessly – moving the same piece several times in the opening or bringing his bishops out before the knights – punishment will come swiftly.
The purpose of chess being to win, not to entertain the gallery with pretty pictures on the chessboard, it is no wonder that many players prefer the ‘dull, safe Queen’s Gambit’ to the romantic but risky adventures of the kingside gambits.
I venture to say (and this opinion has forty years of research behind it) that the queen’s pawn openings have contributed as many masterpieces and as many genuine brilliancies as did any of the kingside openings. </s>"

Accepting the gambit is perfectly sound, but the resulting play requires great care on Black’s part. Above all, he must not hold on to the extra pawn for too long. </s>"

However, the solution is not quite so simple! The bishop’s absence from the queenside weakens that section of the board and leaves the b-pawn vulnerable. Another drawback in Black’s move is that it violates one of the precepts for sound development:
Bring out your knights before the bishops! Instead of the text-move, Black’s best bet is in counterattack, viz.: 3...e5 4 Bxc4 (or 4 dxe5 Qxd1+ 5 Kxd1 Be6) 4...exd4 5 exd4 Bb4+.
Attempting to hold on to the extra pawn might lead Black into one of the traps prepared for the greedy: 3 ...b5 4 a4 c6 5 axb5 cxb5 6 Qf3, and White wins a piece. </s>"

Developing one of the knights first is somewhat risky. For instance, 4 ...Nf6 5 Qb3 threatens to win a pawn by 6 Qxb7 or 6 Bxf7+, or if 4 ...Nc6 5 Qb3 Na5, then 6 Bxf7+ Kd7 7 Qd5+ Kc8 8 Qxf5+ Kb8 9 Qxa5, and White wins two pieces. Even at this early stage White is directing events. </s>"

His purpose is to punish Black for faulty development. Black’s play has not been normal procedure, and the way to take advantage of his sins is not with routine moves.
White’s move, developing a piece with a threat (6 Qxb7) keeps Black on the run. It does not give him time to consolidate his position. </s>"

It stands at c6, depriving the b8-knight of its natural square of development in the opening. Worse yet, it obstructs the c-pawn.

Before making his next move, White must decide whether to continue bringing pieces into play or to try exploiting his present lead in development.
Thus, he pauses to take stock before committing himself to a definite course of action.
He has a pawn stationed at d5, which at first glance is doing an excellent job. It prevents Black’s b8-knight from developing at c6, keeps the d7-bishop from coming to e6, and restrains the f6-knight. The pawn does this single- handed, but at a price! In standing at d5 it occupies a square that should be reserved for pieces. Pieces have more mobility than pawns and can attack more readily. Pieces can utilize d5 as a jumping-off square, a point of departure to any part of the board. In fact, the wretched pawn does a disservice in obstructing the diagonal of the bishop and the supporting queen and takes up room on a file which should be open! Better that the d5-square be vacant than that a pawn block traffic there! (And in this last sentence, as we shall see, is the key to White’s problem).
What about Black’s prospects? With the exception of the f6-knight, his pieces are confined to the first two ranks. His position is a bit crowded, but if he gets a chance to castle and reorganize his forces, it will be hard to subdue him.
White must not allow him time to do this. White must not dawdle! </s>"

 The d-pawn occupies an important square in the centre and attacks two valuable points, e5 and c5.
 Control of these squares keeps the opponent from making use of them for his pieces.
 The queen and dark-squared bishop can now leave the first rank.
 The king is safe from some of the surprise attacks that occur in king’s pawn openings. These come about when Black develops his f8-bishop at c5 and sacrifices it for White’s f2-pawn to force the king out into the open and subject him to assault by the other pieces. </s>"

The threat, a positional one, is 3 cxd5, when after the recapture 3 ...Qxd5, 4 Nc3 drives the queen off and leaves White dominating the centre.
The offer of a pawn has as its purpose the removal of Black’s d-pawn from its fine position in the centre. This offer, unlike the one in the King’s Gambit, involves no risk. White regains the pawn easily and retains an advantage. It is in effect an exchange of a flank pawn for Black’s centre pawn. The point of playing 2 c4 so soon is that it disputes the centre at once, without endangering the safety of the king.
There is also another purpose – a strategic one. An exchange of pawns must come, sooner or later, resulting in the opening of the c-file. Ownership of this file is of paramount importance in the Queen’s Gambit. White generally tries to get full possession of it by posting his queen at c2, and developing his queen’s rook at c1.
Control of this file and of the c5-square on this file is equivalent to control of the game. Of such peculiar significance is this c5-square that it is almost enough simply to plant a piece securely there to get a paralysing grip on Black’s game. </s>"

He does not care to capture by 2...dxc4 as that means surrendering the centre to gain a pawn which he cannot hold on to. White, in reply to this, would play 3 Nf3 (to prevent 3...e5), follow up with 4 e3, and then get the pawn back by 5 Bxc4, with a central superiority.
Defending the d-pawn by 2...Nf6 is weak. White would play in response 3 cxd5, and Black would have to recapture with a piece. On 3...Qxd5, 4 Nc3 banishes the queen from the centre and costs Black time, while 3...Nxd5 lets White seize the centre with 4 e4 and evict the knight in the process.
After the actual move, Black is set to meet 3 cxd5 by 3...exd5, keeping his hold on the centre by maintaining a pawn there. </s>"

This latter consists of 5 cxd5 exd5 6 Bxf6 gxf6 (or 6...Qxf6 7  Nxd5, and White wins a pawn) and Black’s kingside pawn position is shattered.
The opening thus far had been given sporadic earlier trials by various players, but Pillsbury was the first to appreciate its enormous winning possibilities. He pictured the bishop move (most masters brought the bishop quietly into the game at f4) as a sort of Ruy Lopez on the other side of the board! With this particular sequence of moves, which he perfected and popularized, he achieved some remarkable victories, notably in his debut at the Hastings 1895 tournament.
In this game, we see him applying the great power of the Queen’s Gambit to crush an opponent who is not familiar with its fine points and who puts up less than flawless defence. He beats Mason ‘like a child’, as Marshall used to express it. </s>"

It took many years, and a great many losses by Black, to discover that an early fianchetto of the bishop was not an easy solution to the problem of the bishop’s development.
After a great deal of trial and error, a reasonable defence was hit upon, which consisted of playing ...dxc4 at an early stage, followed after suitable preparation by an attack on White’s d-pawn by ...c5 or ...e5. The first of these moves (...c5) is intended to dispute control of the centre, open the c-file for the use of Black’s pieces and in general free his cramped position. The attack by ...e5 is meant to take away the control of e5 from White’s d-pawn, and to open a diagonal for Black’s c8-bishop.
In short, Black first puts up a fight for the centre before he thinks of developing the bishop.
It is of almost vital importance that Black play ...c5 sooner or later. This move strikes at White’s d-pawn, establishes tension in the centre, opens the c-file for his own major pieces and frees the crowded position on the queenside. Failure to make this move permits White to seize control of the c- file and the c5-square. Should White manage to post a piece on that square, it will exert terrific pressure on Black’s entire position, and this one factor alone may be enough to cause Black’s downfall. </s>"

At c2, the queen supplements the rook’s action in exploiting the c-file, while in another direction guards the strategically important e4-square from invasion by Black’s f6-knight. At e2, the queen prevents Black from breaking up the kingside pawn position by 10...Bxf3, supports an advance of the e-pawn which would monopolize the centre, and clears the way for the f1-rook to reach d1.
Developing the queen to e2 offers another advantage: attack on the queenside. By playing 11 Ba6, White can force an exchange of bishops and then bring pressure to bear on Black’s light squares, weakened by the removal of the bishop controlling those squares. </s>"

Ordinarily, this is commendable procedure, but all strategy must be conditioned by the circumstances, the position at hand. All moves must be made with respect to the threats of the opponent, not to arbitrary judgements which declare that certain moves are always ‘good’ or ‘bad’. All moves must be measured by their worth in the particular position being played.
White has declared his intention of piling up as much pressure as possible on the c-file and on the c6-pawn. Black must meet that threat by bringing all his resources to bear for defence of the file, or institute a counterattack vigorous enough to divert White’s forces from the assault.
Black must do something to resolve his immediate difficulties, and he must do it at once, before his opponent gets a death grip on the open file.
With his last move, Black misses a golden opportunity – his last chance to play 15...c5, establish a state of tension in the centre, and give his pieces more room to move around in. </s>"

White begins by placing a pawn where it takes complete possession of one important square and attacks two others. Control of the two squares e5 and c5 makes it impossible for Black to place pieces there. White can hope to use e5 and c5 as outposts for his pieces, which will have the support of the d-pawn.
The advance of the d-pawn serves an additional purpose in opening lines for White’s queen and c1-bishop. </s>"

In effect, it is an offer to exchange a flank pawn for a centre pawn, as White can regain the pawn without any trouble.
Concealed in White’s proposal is a threat of destroying Black’s pawn- centre by 3 cxd5 Qxd5 4 Nc3 (gaining a tempo, as White develops a piece while Black must move the same one again) 4 ...Qa5 5 e4, and White’s control of the centre is imposing. </s>"

If White plays 3 cxd5, Black can recapture with a pawn and maintain a pawn in the centre.
Black does not capture White’s c4-pawn as that means surrendering the centre and his grip on e4.
The shutting in of his c8-bishop (after 2...e6) and the consequent difficulty in developing that piece effectively is one of the reasons for the popularity of the Queen’s Gambit – for White. </s>"

The threat is actually of minor importance. White’s real aim in pinning the knight is not to institute a threat that can so easily be parried. What White is interested in is the most effective placement of his pieces, and the development of the bishop at g5 is extremely strong. The restraint it places on Black’s knight and the cramping effect it has on Black’s whole game is not easily shaken off. </s>"

At d7 it supports the other knight and helps prepare the advance of the c-pawn to c5. The b8-knight must not move to c6, where it obstructs the c- pawn. The c-pawn must be free to advance and attack White’s centre.

At c2, the queen exerts pressure on the c-file (which will be strongly evident after centre pawns are exchanged) and controls the e4-square. The latter circumstance is the reason for the queen coming into play at this point, instead of the expected mobilization of the kingside pieces. It is vital to guard the e4-square so that Black cannot free himself easily by playing 7 ...Ne4 and exchanging some pieces. </s>"

Instead of the passive kingside castling, Black should have tried for counterplay by 7...dxc4 8 Bxc4 e5!, which disputes control of the centre and helps clear a diagonal for his c8-bishop. </s>"

It is an attack in that White threatens by 3 cxd5 Qxd5 4 Nc3 Qa5 5 e4 to establish two pawns abreast in the centre. It is an offer, since Black can gain a pawn (temporarily, it is true) by 2...dxc4.

Black’s second move has the merit of not shutting in the c8-bishop, as the alternative 2...e6 does. On the debit side though, if Black does develop his bishop freely, he must be prepared to beat off troublesome attacks on his d- pawn and his b-pawn, occasioned by the absence of the bishop. Another and more important consideration is that while the c-pawn standing at c6 represents a fine support for the d-pawn, it is not fulfilling its main purpose in life, which is to challenge White’s control of the centre. It must be available to advance to c5 in order to attack White’s d-pawn and to open the c-file for the use of Black’s heavy pieces. </s>"

These are some of the reasons he does not do so:
1)It is good strategy to maintain tension in the centre – to keep the pawn position fluid, not static.
2)In advancing to c5, White gives up his attack on the enemy centre, and the option of exchanging pawns when it is worthwhile to do so. Such an exchange might be the means of demolishing Black’s whole centre!
3)The c5-square should be an outpost for a piece, not a pawn. A piece posted there exerts a tremendous effect on Black’s whole queenside.
4)Placing a pawn at c5 closes the c-file and makes it useless for the operations of the queen or the rooks.
5)In the opening, pieces, not pawns, should be moved.
All the foregoing explains why a chess master ‘instinctively’ finds the right moves. It is not that he can analyse twenty moves ahead, or that he bothers to examine the effects of every possible move. Sometimes he does not even look one move ahead! He saves time by dismissing from consideration any move which his instinct (or more accurately his experience and judgement) warns is contrary to principle and cannot possibly lead to favourable results. By discarding moves which offend his feeling for what is proper, by avoiding artificial expedients which are distasteful to his positional judgement, he plays stronger, sounder chess at ten seconds a move than does the average amateur in his serious tournament games. </s>"

Black’s intentions are still unclear. He might capture the c4-pawn next move and then try to hold on to it by ...b5, or he might go in for the Stonewall formation, by playing 4...f5 followed by 5 ...Nf6 and possibly 6 ...Ne4. </s>"

Before White makes his next move, let us sum up his advantages:
 His pawn position in the centre, restraining the free movements of the enemy pieces, is definitely superior to Black’s.
 His queen attacks nine squares while Black’s is limited to five.
 His bishops control thirteen squares, whereas Black’s are limited to seven.
 His knight enjoys wonderful mobility, while Black’s knight can only retreat.
Clearly, White has established a definite positional superiority. His pieces have greater mobility, as simple arithmetic shows, and their power to attack is definitely greater than that of Black’s army. White has earned the right to look for a decisive combination that will exploit to the full his positional advantages.
It is interesting to see what form of attack will succeed in breaking through Black’s strongly entrenched position. </s>"

Today, when everyone wants to win with the minimum of risk, 1 d4 has become equally popular. The queen’s pawn openings lead to positions which are safe and sound. They offer security, and as additional inducement let White have a slight advantage right from the start.

One advantage of 3...c5 is that it disputes possession of the centre at once by the attack on the d4-pawn. Another is that it enables Black to post his queen’s knight at c6, instead of at d7 where it interferes for a long time with the career of the c8-bishop. </s>"

Explain why it is the best move.     ### Chess board positions: r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/3p4/3p4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8 ### Next Move: 8 Nxd4 ### Explanation: [/INST] The recapture leaves Black with an isolated pawn in the centre of the board. Such a pawn must depend on pieces to defend it from attack, as there are no pawns on either side that can come to its support. Another consideration is that an enemy piece can be posted firmly on the square directly in front of the isolated pawn, in this case d4, without any fear of being driven off by a pawn.
All this is very discouraging, but in return for these shortcomings, the possessor of the isolated pawn is rewarded with open files and diagonals – room for the activities of his pieces. The pawn itself, in spite of its forlorn appearance, often becomes the spearhead that pierces and breaks up a fortified position.
The theorists themselves are not in complete agreement on the merits or demerits of an isolated pawn. Many years ago, Philidor said in his Chess Analysed: or Instructions by Which a Perfect Knowledge of This Noble Game May in a Short Time Be Acquired: “A pawn, when separated from his fellows, will seldom or never make a fortune.” For the defence, we have Tarrasch, who said, “He who fears possession of an isolated d-pawn should give up chess.”
There are arguments for both sides: Black has in his favour: increased mobility for his pieces, possible outposts for his pieces at e4 and c4 (supported by the d-pawn) and open files for his major pieces (the e- and c-files).
White has advantages in the fact that he can station a piece permanently at d4 and can keep Black busy warding off threats to the d-pawn. Not that the pawn can easily be captured, since the number of pieces attacking it can always be equalled by the number of pieces defending it, but by virtue of the fact that the pawn needs constant care, White can switch the attack to another section of the board. Black must not only be prepared to fight back there but also keep in close touch with the weak pawn. </s>"

He relieves Black of the isolated pawn, but in return fixes him with other weaknesses. From now on White will forget about the d5-square and turn his attention to dominating d4 and c5 completely. By anchoring pieces on those squares he can prevent Black from advancing his d-pawn or his c-pawn.

These are good and natural moves, but they do not fit in with the strategic concept governing this position. Once there is a definite, logical plan to follow, we must play moves that conform to that plan, so that the improvement of our own position or the undermining of the opponent’s is conducted systematically and not as a result of accidental circumstances. Development, at this point, must not be carried out for its own sake.
It may seem strange that control of one square can cause a position to collapse, but it is true. It is one of the fine points in the Queen’s Gambit that such domination (resulting from Black’s neglect to dispute the centre and also free his queenside by ...c5) enables White to confine his opponent’s pieces to a small area and drive them back step by step, while he (White) either starts escorting a pawn to the queening square or turns to the other side of the board and beleaguers the enemy king. </s>"

However, after 18 bxc5 the pawn stationed at c5 is not only immobile and useless but itself closes the c-file to White’s pieces. This would negate the whole strategy of the position, which is to occupy the weak squares in the opponent’s position with pieces, not pawns. Pieces can be freely moved about, so that lines are kept open for the attack, and one blockader can make room for a different one, if occasion demands it. </s>"

Either move establishes a pawn in the centre, while permitting two pieces to come into play.
Which move should you adopt? The choice is a matter of taste. Broadly speaking, 1 e4 leads more often to wide-open attacking games, while 1 d4 tends toward a struggle for positional advantage. Blackburne says, “The first piece of advice I would offer to the young student who wishes to improve his chess is that in the formation of his style he should try to follow his own aptitude and temperament. One player derives pleasure in working a game out accurately like a sum in mathematics; another cares for nothing but ingenious combinations and brilliant attacks.

The general plan of the Colle is to advance the e-pawn to e4, after suitable preparation. This consists of the following manoeuvres:
1)developing the f1-bishop at d3, to reinforce the pressure on the vital e4- square and to attack Black’s h-pawn, a tender point after he castles;
2)posting the queen’s knight at d2 (not at c3, as the c-pawn must not be obstructed), to bear down on e4 and lend support to the e-pawn when it reaches that square;
3)castling on the kingside, to mobilize the h1-rook;
4)developing the queen at e2 and/or the rook at e1, to add further weight to the contemplated pawn push;
5)advancing the pawn to e4.
The pawn moves only one square, but it sets all the machinery in motion: the position in the centre will be ripped apart and lines opened for White’s attacking forces. </s>"

This is the best possible disposition of the king’s knight. It is developed toward the centre, so as to take part in the events there. It is in the centre that most of the fighting takes place, and whatever happens there affects the rest of the chessboard. Superiority in the centre is essential for a positional advantage, and control of the centre is indispensable to the successful conduct of a kingside attack.
All development should therefore be conducted with a view to the effect on the centre.
A plausible move, instead of the text, is the advance 4...c4 to prevent White from placing his bishop at d3. It is the kind of move many players find irresistible, but it must be avoided. It is an error in strategy, as it relaxes the pressure on White’s d-pawn and the centre.
  It is important to keep the pawn position in the centre fluid.

The text-move was made with these further considerations in mind:
1)Black’s bishop, which has moved once, will have to waste a move in recapturing the pawn;
2)this bishop, needed for the defence of the kingside, will find itself on the wrong side of the board;
3)at c5, the bishop will stand unprotected and subject to a surprise attack;
4)White’s knight at d2 will gain a tempo later by moving to b3, where it threatens the exposed bishop while simultaneously clearing a way for his own dark-squared bishop;
5)in the ending, if it comes to that, White will have the favourable arrangement of three pawns to two on the queenside. </s>"

How should Black reply? If he exchanges by 10...dxe4, then after 11 Nxe4 Nxe4 12 Qxe4, he is threatened with the devastating 13 Qxh7+. No longer does he have a knight at f6 (the best defender of a castled position) so he
would have to weaken himself by moving one of the pawns in front of the king.
If he avoids exchanging pawns and plays 10...d4 instead, then comes 11 Nb3 Bb6 (the bishop must stay in touch with the d-pawn) 12 e5 Nd5, and White should win “accurately like a sum in mathematics”, as Blackburne puts it, by 13 cxd4. </s>"

The dark-squared bishop comes into active play with gain of tempo. The attack on the queen is incidental to the bishop’s real purpose, which is to gain control of c5 for itself or the knight.

Accepting White’s pawn offer by 2...dxc4 is not recommended policy. Black could not hold on to the extra pawn, so that in the end it would amount to exchanging a centre pawn for a side pawn. It is true that the text-move limits the c8-bishop’s scope, but it is a necessary evil of what is probably Black’s soundest defence. In this lies the great strength of the Queen’s Gambit (for White) and its popularity with the majority of players who feel happy with an opening which lets them exert pressure from the very first move. </s>"

Strangely enough, although Pillsbury used this move to great effect in a magnificent victory over Tarrasch at Hastings in 1895, the comment on it by Gunsberg, who annotated the game for the tournament book, was, “No good results from this early sortie of the bishop. The attack, or perhaps better speaking, would-be attack differs from similar play in the French Defence, inasmuch as White has not the move e5 at his command. Generally speaking, both the first and the second player in this opening require their queen’s bishop on the queenside.”
This view, it turned out, easily qualified for ‘the clouded crystal ball department’. Pillsbury utilized the attack stemming from 4 Bg5 for some of his most marvellous triumphs, defeating such masters of the game as Steinitz, Maroczy, Janowsky, Burn, Marco and Tarrasch. Others who evaded this line, such as Lasker, Marshall and Chigorin (to name a few) fell victims to other forms of the Queen’s Gambit. Gunsberg, who criticized this form of attack so severely, chose what Lasker called “a peculiar, but not altogether sound, manner of development”, with the result that Pillsbury defeated him in an ending which is one of the most beautiful in the literature of chess. In short, it was Pillsbury’s great success with the Queen’s Gambit that revealed its terrific strength to the other masters and gave it a popularity that has continued to this day. </s>"

Black wants to attack on the queenside where, after playing 11...c4, he will have a three to two pawn majority. What he underestimates is the speed and vigour with which White can get an attack rolling on the kingside. It will strike faster and with more force than any action of Black’s on the queenside. Black must deprive White’s attack of some of its strength by effecting some exchanges and then counterattacking in the centre. One possibility was 10 ...Ne8 11 Bxe7 Qxe7 12 O-O Nxe5 13 fxe5 f6. This would comply with two important principles in defence: An exchange relieves a crowded position. An attack on a wing is best met by play in the centre. </s>"

This is commendable strategy for the ending, but Black has not yet survived the middlegame!
The move 11...c4 is a strategic error. It removes the pressure on White’s d- pawn and relieves the tension. As long as Black has the option of capturing the d-pawn and disturbing White’s centre, it is difficult for White to stabilize the centre. And until the centre is stabilized, the success of a kingside attack for White is doubtful.
The moral is clear: keep the pawn position in the centre fluid; reserve the option of capturing the central pawn. </s>"

1)16 Qxd7 Nxd7 17 Bxe7, and White gains a piece.

“All this is very interesting,” you might say, “but how does White plan this series of moves? What makes him look at even so much as the first move in the combination?”
Very well! Let’s try to follow his line of reasoning:
White attacks the critical point, Black’s h7-pawn, with queen and bishop.
If this pawn were protected only by the king, White could capture it and announce mate.
But the pawn has another protector, a knight. How about removing the knight?
That would not do. It would only be replaced by another knight.
How about getting rid of the other knight? With that knight disposed of, wouldn’t the whole structure collapse?
Once White thinks in this direction and sees the first move in the combination, the rest of it plays itself. In fact, once he finds the key – removing the knight which protects the knight which protects against mate – he can win any way he pleases. </s>"

What then has White accomplished, if his mating combination can so easily be frustrated?
It is true that White has not inflicted mate, but the threat of doing so has enabled him to achieve his real objective – a disturbance in the line-up of pawns near Black’s king. This change in the pawn configuration weakens the entire defensive structure. After Black’s actual move, his f6-knight, deprived of its pawn support, is a vulnerable object of attack, notwithstanding the fact that it is protected by three pieces.

In fact, if White tries something like 18 Bxf6  Bxf6 19 Rxf6 Qxf6 20 Qxf6 Nxf6, he finds himself a rook down. So direct assault doesn’t do it! The answer must then lie in indirect means.

With the first move, White occupies the centre with a pawn and frees two of the queenside pieces.
His general plan of development runs somewhat as follows: He will establish and maintain at least one pawn in the centre. This pawn will act as a support to a knight outpost at e5 or c5.
The bishops are to take charge of key diagonals or pin enemy pieces. The rooks are to control the open or partly open files.
The queen should stand at c2 or e2, close to home but off the back rank. The king should find safety in castling, preferably on the kingside.
Basically, White’s aim is to gain space and crowd Black to the wall. With less room to move around in, and with the consequent difficulty of manoeuvring his pieces effectively, Black will be forced to weaken his position. He will have to make some poor moves, because good moves are not easily available in a cramped position. The weaknesses will come to light, and the opportunity to exploit them will come in the form of a combination, resolving the issue at one stroke. </s>"

Aside from the fact that making so many pawn moves in the opening is a flagrant violation of principle, the adoption of a system which calls for the launching of an attack by a preconceived formation of pieces, without regard to the advisability of an attack and without reference to the requirements of the particular position, is contrary to the concept of proper strategy and to the spirit of chess itself. What such an expedition amounts to is undertaking the risk of assuming the offensive against an enemy whose force is equal, whose line-up of power is unknown and who has betrayed no vulnerable points. Under these conditions, an attack is premature and is sure to be repulsed and turned into a disorderly retreat.

The pawn cluster in the centre is completely immobilized.
All the pieces are still on the first rank.
Aside from the features of this particular position, it is important to appreciate the peculiar strength with which a rook is imbued when it dominates (as Black’s does) the seventh rank:
 It attacks the pawns still remaining on the rank, striking all along the line, so that defending them is difficult.
 The rook can get behind pawns that have moved off the rank and maintain constant pressure, since the pawns are always under attack by the rook, no matter how far up the file they move.
 The rook restrains the enemy king from coming out to take a hand in the ending, by guarding the line of exit.
The moral is:
In the opening, shift the rooks toward the centre, on files likely to be opened.
In the middlegame, seize the open files and command them with your rooks.
In the ending, post your rooks on the seventh rank. Doubled rooks on the seventh rank are almost irresistible in mating attacks. If there is little material left on the board, the seventh rank is a convenient means of manoeuvring a rook behind enemy pawns. </s>"

Explain why it is the best move.     ### Chess board positions: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1 ### Next Move: 1 d4 ### Explanation: [/INST] The popular impression of king’s pawn openings is that they offer all sorts of opportunities for whipping up a quick attack. A variety of gambits can be played, pieces may be sacrificed to open lines, combinations ventured on, and speculation indulged in – anything for the sake of mate. Sometimes these tactics succeed, but very often the gambit player finds himself at the wrong end of the attack, as wide-open positions are as dangerous for one side as for the other.
In queen’s pawn openings, the ideal to strive for is development for its own sake. The attack is not the ‘be-all and end-all’. It is not deliberately played for, but, strangely enough, the very fact that all the pieces are developed economically, that they are put to work as quickly as possible on the squares where they function best, seems to imbue them with marvellous powers of attack. Combinations come into life out of nothing! Can it be that the simple posting of pieces where they have the greatest freedom of movement and the greatest command of the board generates in them so much dynamic energy that it must be released somehow? And can it be that knowledge of this fact is what makes the virtuosi of positional play repress their instinct to attack until the time is ripe for an attack to be unleashed?
White’s move of the d-pawn begins the process of getting all the pieces into play as quickly as possible. Two of them are now free to make their debut, while the pawn that released them occupies the centre of the stage. </s>"

4)it hinders Black from establishing a pawn in the centre by 2...d5, as White’s reply 3 cxd5 compelling a recapture with a piece would leave Black with no pawn in the centre. </s>"

There is a prevalent concept that in the opening there is a ‘best move’ at every point. The belief is that the chess master memorizes every one of these best moves and its proper reply. That such reasoning is specious is obvious: the very fact that millions of games have been played without duplication of moves is proof enough in itself.
Let us consider the position on the board. Besides the text-move (4 c2), there are at least seven excellent alternatives, each of which has enthusiastic advocates. They are: 4 Qb3; 4 Bd2; 4 a3; 4 Bg5; 4 e3; 4 g3; and 4 Nf3. Which of these is best? No one can say for sure, but the move that leads into positions congenial to your style is the best move, and the one you should play. </s>"

The move he plays immediately disputes White’s control of the centre. It does other things, too: it gives the queen more scope, opens the c-file, protects the bishop, etc.
However, there are other moves, equally effective, at Black’s disposal. He can select from these replies, each of which has something to recommend it:

White does not lose time in taking the pawn, as Black in recapturing will return the lost tempo. The open d-file resulting from 5 dxc5 will benefit White, who will occupy d 1 with a rook and exert pressure along the length of it, especially endangering the backward d-pawn.
Other continuations are less energetic. For instance, after 5 e3, Black frees himself by 5...d5, while after 5 Nf3 cxd4 6 Nxd4 Nc6 White has lost the initiative. </s>"

Black should instead do something to get his c8-bishop into play, for example 8...a6 9 Be2 dxc4 10 Bxc4 b5 11 Be2 Qb6 (not at once 11 ...Bb7 on account of 12 Nxb5) 12 O-O Bb7. </s>"

It accomplishes these objectives:
1)it activates a piece, by getting it off the first rank;
2)it develops the bishop at e2 so that it can move to f3 and attack the centre;
3)it clears away the kingside, making early castling possible;
4)it prepares the cooperation of the rooks on the first rank, subsequent to castling.
What was wrong with playing the more aggressive-looking 9 Bd3? For one thing, the reply 9 ...Nb4 enables Black to force an exchange of knight for bishop. White would lose the services of a piece valuable for its potential influence on the centre. Why not then prepare to develop the bishop at d3 by playing 9 a3 first? The answer is that time is too valuable in the opening to waste on unnecessary pawn moves. Only those pawn moves that are essential to the development of pieces should be made. The additional circumstance that 9 a3 weakens the light squares on the queenside is more proof that such strategy is artificial and time-wasting. </s>"

1)he has two active bishops against Black’s knight and bishop;

2)all of his minor pieces are in play while Black still has a bishop on the first rank;
3)his rooks are in touch with each other and ready to seize the half-open b- and d-files;

True, the pawn is defended, but by a bishop which cannot develop without abandoning the pawn. Sooner or later, Black will be compelled to play ...b6, or have three pieces on his first rank interfering with each other. There are drawbacks to ...b6, though, for example Black’s queen will be cut off and prevented from returning to the kingside and the defence of the king. In addition, his c6-knight’s position will be insecure, once the prop (the b7- pawn) is removed from under it.
White’s move is simple and quiet, but it exerts uncomfortable pressure on Black’s queenside, makes normal development difficult, and creates permanent weaknesses which lend themselves to exploitation. </s>"

In the event of White’s playing 3 cxd5, Black must be ready to replace the d-pawn with another pawn. It would not do to recapture with a piece. The piece could be driven off by White’s e-pawn, leaving White in full possession of the central squares.

This does not look like much of a move for so powerful a piece as the queen, but the simple act of getting a piece off the back rank advances the cause of development and constitutes progress.
Two more points: in the early stages of the game, the queen is most happily placed close to home, for instance at c2 or e2. In getting off the back rank, the queen permits the rooks (after the king castles) to get in touch with each other. A more aggressive development (generally for the sake of picking up a stray pawn) is only courting danger. </s>"

In this particular position, Black could hardly delay opposing rooks, as he was threatened with invasion on the seventh rank by 19 Rd7, as well as 19 Qd2, tripling the heavy pieces on the file. Such a massing of power on the

Nimzowitsch calls particular attention to “the lust to expand in a passed pawn” and says that it must be regarded as “a criminal who should be kept under lock and key”.
To prevent any further advance of the passed pawn, Black must blockade it by placing a piece in its path. In effect, to keep the pawn under surveillance, he must lose the services of one of his four remaining pieces! If constant vigilance is necessary to keep the pawn quiescent, it is obvious that Black will be too busy defending to think of counter-attack. On the other hand, White is free to switch the attack from one point to another! </s>"

Such decisions are a matter of style more than anything else. A player who has choice of more than one way of winning should select a method that is congenial to his temperament and aptitudes. In the present position, I imagine that a Rubinstein or a Capablanca would unhesitatingly offer the exchange of queens and simplify, confident in his ability to turn a small but safe advantage into a win; they would be happy to leave the brilliancies to other masters. It is to these varying techniques that we must be grateful for the creation of a wealth of masterpieces in so many colours and moods.

After the actual move, the change in the pawn configuration provides White with fresh objects of attack. One thing he must watch out for, though, is the preservation of his invaluable e-pawn, which so stoutly supports the two advanced pawns. Note that the position of these pawns gives them a powerful grip on the dark squares c7, e7 and g7. These squares are in the enemy’s camp and close to his king, but he (Black) cannot place pieces on those squares. With fewer facilities at his disposal, it will be difficult for Black to beat back the invaders.

Black’s first move has the defect that only one piece is released, but in one respect it has a similar aim to 1...e5: it covers d4 and so makes it more awkward for White to form a ‘two-abreast’ pawn-centre by playing d4. If White insists on d4, then Black can reply ...cxd4, thereby exchanging White’s central pawn for a less central one.
The Sicilian Defence is perfectly sound and leads to a fighting game in which Black has many counterattacking chances, especially against an over- ambitious opponent, too intent on a kingside attack.
Black aims at queenside counterattack, and for this, control of the cfile is essential to offset White’s superiority in the centre and on the kingside. </s>"

3)Preventing the pin by 6 a3 is not attractive. It is answered by 6 ...d5, and White must fight to retain the initiative. Time is too valuable in the opening to waste on pawn moves.
4)The double-edged 6 Ndb5 is not to everybody’s taste, leading as it does to wild complications after 6 ...Bb4 7 Bf4 Nxe4 8 Nc7+ Kf8 9 Qf3 d5 10 O-O-O or the sharp Pelikan variation after 6...d6 7 Bf4 e5 8 Bg5.
One merit of the text-move is that Black, in recapturing with a pawn, closes the c-file, his chief avenue of attack in the Sicilian. </s>"

If the queen cannot establish permanent residence at d6, this square is the next best thing.

In the ending, the king is unexcelled as a means of causing damage by getting in among the enemy’s pawns.
That is why, in the present position, the king comes closer to the centre, where he is most useful, instead of castling and then working his way there. </s>"

The latter is greatly hampered in its movements by the many pawns standing on light squares, the colour of the squares on which the bishop operates.
White’s king, being nearer the centre and the critical squares d4 and e5, is much better situated for the endgame than Black’s.
Black’s centre, the heart of his game, is held fast. The three pawns he has in that area are fixed and unable to move. </s>"

The a5-pawn is stopped dead in its tracks; it is now a fixed target, always in danger of being attacked by Bb6.

The bishop stops the h8-rook from getting to f8, the a6-rook from moving to b6, the king from d6, the d-pawn from advancing and the c-pawn from moving at all! Compare its control of eight squares with that of Black’s bishop, whose influence is confined to one square!

Notice the effects of the arrangement of Black’s pawns at e6, d5 and c6 – Black’s own pieces are kept under restraint, while White’s can utilize the weakened dark squares c5, d4, e5 and f6 to penetrate into the vitals of the enemy position. Notice also that these dark squares are ‘holes’, squares from which pieces cannot be dislodged by the opponent’s pawns.
White does not resort to brutal attack or to intricate combination to accomplish his purpose but puts his trust in the dynamic power inherent in an overwhelming positional superiority. </s>"

The versatile c-pawn does many things. Three of these things are concerned with doing away with Black’s centre:
 It offers itself in exchange, so that Black may be lured into accepting a side pawn in return for his centre pawn.
 It threatens, when the right moment comes, to destroy Black’s centre by capturing the d-pawn.
 It exerts constant pressure on the d-pawn, so that Black is kept occupied with its protection.
Besides all this, the move of the c-pawn assures that the c-file is kept free and clear for the convenience of White’s major pieces, while a pathway is opened for the queen, leading to the queenside. </s>"

Another feature of 7 Qc2 is that it vacates d1 for the queen’s rook, whose presence on the same file as Black’s queen will discourage the opponent from making a break in the centre. Exchanges of pawns in the centre would clear away some of the obstructions and intensify the rook’s pressure on the file – a pressure which reaches all the way up the file to the queen. </s>"

The subject of mobility is interesting. While it is not always true that the player whose pieces have more room in which to manoeuvre enjoys an advantage, it applies often enough in practice for us to disregard the exceptional cases. It stands to reason that pieces that are free and untrammelled not only have more striking power in the portion of the board they occupy, but they also control and limit the activities of the enemy. Add to this the ease with which they can reach other parts of the board, and you can see the advantages to be derived from the ability to move freely about. </s>"

White could then continue by 29 Rh5 Kg7 (if 29...gxh5, then 30  Qh7#, or if 29 ...Kh7, then 30 Qf4 wins) 30 Qe5+ f6 (or 30 ...Kh7, when the neat double pin 31 Qg5 wins) 31 Qg3 g5 (if 31...f5, then 32 Qe5+ Kh7 33 Qc7+ Kg8 34 Rxh6 wins) 32 Rxh6! Kxh6 33 Qh3+ Kg7 34 Qh7#.
A simpler way, if White doesn’t want to bother analysing combinations, is to maintain the pressure and then apply more! For instance, after 27...h6 28 Qe4 g6, instead of playing 29 Rh5 White could advance 29 h4, threatening to break up the pawns by 30 h5. If Black replies 29...h5 to stop the advance,
White can either snap the h-pawn off with his rook or keep hammering away by 30 g4 hxg4 31 h5.
After the actual move, Black has weaknesses on the dark squares and holes in his position. </s>"

...g6 advance. A hole is an unguarded square such as f6 or h6 brought into being by the advance of a nearby pawn. It is a weak square, because it is no longer under the surveillance of a pawn and is vulnerable to invasion by an enemy piece. Such a piece can settle itself comfortably in one of these holes, secure in the knowledge that no enemy pawn can disturb it.
White’s plan, now that the queen has worked her way into a dominating position on the kingside, is classical in its simplicity: he will just advance the h-pawn to h4, h5 and h6, and then play Qg7#. If, after the pawn reaches h5, it is captured en route, then mate by the rook is the instant punishment. </s>"

A pretty enough conclusion, but pedants may point out that White missed a brilliancy in 38 Qg7+ Ke7 39 Rxe6+! Kxe6 40 Qe5#. Many a player has had quicker wins or more artistic ones than actually occurred pointed out to him by lesser lights, who revel in the fact that they found something the master overlooked. The reason the master didn’t see the shorter line is that he was not looking for it in the first place! The move with which he wins is the one whose effects he foresaw earlier and analysed thoroughly before starting his final combination. Once the series of forcing moves clicks, there is no reason at all for him to waste time finding other moves that might win. It takes time to analyse combinations, and the shorter way, ventured on hurriedly, might turn out to have a hole in it. The moral is: play the move that forces the win in the simplest way and leave the brilliancies to Alekhine and Keres. </s>"

Agnel proposed an interesting argument for the superiority of 1 e4 to 1 d4: “Moving the d-pawn two squares,” he said, “gives the queen a range of two squares and the c1-bishop a range of five squares. But moving 1 e4 gives a range of four squares to the queen and five squares to the f1- bishop. You see therefore that e-pawn two squares is the most desirable move with which to open the game. There is another reason why this move is desirable – the pawn occupies a portion of the centre of the board. Two pawns abreast at your e4- and d4-squares, supported by pawns and pieces, must be considered as your best military position, and maintained with all the skill in your power.” </s>"

One of the drawbacks of Black’s system of defence is that it subjects his queen to harassment by the minor pieces without her being able to bother them in return. The queen, for example, cannot threaten to capture a knight that is protected as that amounts to giving up the queen for a knight. The knight, though, can attack and threaten to capture the queen, whether the queen is protected or not. </s>"

Answer: by another pin! Apparently, Black is not interested in routine defence, or for that matter in normal development. He wants his pieces to rush out of their corners fighting. If this strategy is sound, what is to become of all the principles of development – the precepts which in the hand of a master are his greatest weapons?
So far, Black has violated the conventions governing proper development, by these acts:
1)he has brought the queen into play too early;
2)he has moved the same piece twice in the opening;
3)he has developed bishops before knights;
4)he has launched an attack before completing his development. The question is: can he get away with all this? </s>"

One of the points a beginner learns painfully is that he must fight for control of every bit of territory, whether it is a file, a diagonal or a square. It is often necessary to offer an exchange of pieces to secure possession of an important point or area. Such offers must not be avoided for fear of their leading to a dull game, or that such strategy is unsportsmanlike. The player with a material advantage who temporizes because he wants to win brilliantly, and avoids exchanges because they are dull and unsportsmanlike, is only torturing his opponent.

One reason for his view might have been that the e-pawn openings no longer could be depended on to lead to wide-open games with opportunities for combinative play. In the old days when White began with 1 e4, the reply almost automatically was 1...e5. White could then offer a pawn by 2 f4, rely on its being accepted, and joyfully swing into the excitement of a King’s Gambit. In taking the pawn and grimly holding on to it, Black gained material, but the loss of time involved threw him on the defensive. Gradually, after sustaining many defeats, the players of Black tired of being the victims of brilliancies. They took a more rational attitude, and grew cautious. They resorted to 1...e6, 1...c5 or 1...c6, steering the game into channels of their own choosing. The result was that an aggressive player, starting the game with 1 e4, found himself facing ‘irregular’ defences, which forced the game into unfamiliar channels. He found himself involved in tightly knit positions requiring systematic planning, when he was itching to get an attack rolling. He was supposed to have the initiative, but here it was wrested away from him! How could he play a gambit (even at best a risky matter) if his opponent did not oblige him with a forthright 1...e5 in answer to his own enterprising 1 e4?
In beginning the game with 1 d4, White gets an advantage, slight though it may be, against any system of defence – and with it he retains excellent attacking chances as well! </s>"

Playing 2...dxc4 is equivalent to exchanging a centre pawn for a side pawn, in itself an unprofitable transaction. However, many leading players are happy to play this opening, so there must be some counterbalancing plus points. The main advantage is that Black no longer has the responsibility of supporting the d5-pawn, and this makes it easier for him to organize the crucial thrust ...c5, exchanging his own c-pawn for White’s d-pawn. Thus, although White has a temporary superiority in the centre, it is often not long before Black can restore a symmetrical central situation.
After Black’s actual move, his d-pawn is firmly supported. If now 3 cxd5,
Black recaptures with a pawn, maintaining a pawn in the centre.
It is true that Black’s c8-bishop is shut in by the e-pawn, making its development difficult, and this is a drawback to the defence. But if Black’s first two moves are good, and they probably form the best reply to the Queen’s Gambit, then one can appreciate the terrific strength of this opening, and why so many players adopt 1 d4 unhesitatingly whenever they have White. </s>"

It is true that f6 is the most useful square for the king’s knight 99.44% of the time, since from there it influences affairs in the centre strongly, enjoys great freedom of movement, and is magnificently placed for attack and defence. However, Tarrasch feared the strength of the pin that White can clamp on the knight next move. Instead of 3...Nf6, he therefore recommended that Black challenge White’s centre at once by 3...c5 (the advance ...c5 is almost a must at some stage in queen’s pawn games), meanwhile opening up the c-file for the use of his own heavy pieces.

Why then, you may ask, did Tarrasch play a move that he himself disparaged? His explanation is that this was the first game of a match against one of the world’s leading masters (Marshall had recently won the Cambridge Springs tournament without losing a game, ahead of Lasker, Schlechter, Pillsbury and Janowsky) and he did not wish to stray so soon from orthodox paths. </s>"

The knight belongs on d7 and not on c6, where it obstructs the c-pawn. This pawn must not be hindered from advancing sooner or later to c5. Little as the pawn is, it represents a major force in disputing possession of the centre!
With 4...Nbd7 Black sets a little trap for the unwary, invented by Tarrasch. If White, relying on the impotent state of Black’s pinned knight, tries to pick up a pawn by 5 cxd5 exd5 6 Nxd5, Black gives up his queen with 6...Nxd5 (breaking the pin by force) 7 Bxd8, only to regain it with another piece thrown in by 7...Bb4 + 8 Qd2 Bxd2+ 9 Kxd2 Kxd8.

then the bishops (after the necessary pawn moves), either to control vital
diagonals or to pin enemy knights; following this, it is time for the queen to make her entrance. If the queen comes into the game too early, she incurs the danger of being harassed – perhaps even surrounded and captured – by enemy minor pieces.
Last come the rooks, which after castling are brought to e1, d1 or c1, to head files in the centre which are partly open. These files are likely to become completely open after pawn exchanges in the centre.
This method of development is not by any means to be considered a fixed course to pursue. Nothing in chess – no convention, principle or recommended procedure – is to be practised rigidly. The value of any single move or combination of moves can only be measured with respect to the particular position on the board. It must fit in with the scheme of the game you are playing and be tempered by the demands of the opponent. A great deal depends on what he does, or lets you do. This is why you may find it expedient to develop the queen at the sixth move or to castle at the sixtieth move.
In this position Black has indicated that he might counterattack by 6...Qa5 and 7...Bb4, pinning the c3-knight and then increasing the pressure on it. It might have been more to the point for White instead to mobilize another minor piece by 6 Nf3 (like putting money in the bank), with an eye to speedy castling or perhaps to neutralizing the anticipated pressure on the c3-knight by swinging the f3-knight over to d2. </s>"

As an extra, added attraction, Black sets a little trap to catch the careless – and this might even include expert players who at times treat the opening in a perfunctory way. The trap might snap shut on a player who innocently develops his bishop at d3 only to find that 7...dxc4 threatens both his bishops at one blow. White cannot escape from the trap by 8 Bxf6 as 8...cxd3 attacks his queen and wins a bishop.
It might be as well to state at this point that Tarrasch did not expect to catch Marshall with such a primitive trap. Master players do not set traps if it involves injuring their own position. A trap which arises in the natural course of development is one thing, but to play for them deliberately at the risk of wasting valuable time is unforgivable. </s>"

Now he realizes that danger may be involved in delaying the development of the queenside pieces any longer.
His c8-bishop is locked in on one side by the d7-knight, and this knight must stay where it is, as it supports the other knight on f6. If he tries to develop the bishop on the queenside, then after ...b6 he cuts off the queen’s retreat. But the strategy of a master player must be flexible: it must be consistent with the requirements of the particular position at hand. Tarrasch would very much like to have a strong pawn-centre but dares not neglect the exigencies of development. So he heeds Nimzowitsch, who once said, “Giving up the centre must not here be regarded as illogical; was happiness no happiness because it endured for but a short time? One cannot always be happy.”
Meanwhile the knight does add to the pressure on White’s pinned knight and renews the threat of winning the exposed bishop by 8...Nxc3 9 bxc3  Qxg5. </s>"

This is an interesting example of the value of accurate timing in chess. The fact that a normal developing move has intrinsic strength is secondary to the question of its usefulness in the one position in front of you, not in vaguely similar positions.
Despite the fact that the knight occupies a most useful post at f3, and at the same time protects the bishop, its development is either too soon or too late. White is doing nothing about the problem of his pinned knight. This is where pressure is exerted; this is where danger is threatened.
More to the point is 8 e4 instead, evicting Black’s knight and forcing it to declare its intentions. If then 8...Nxc3 9 Bd2 Qa4 10 Qxc3, White has resolved an uncomfortable situation. </s>"

Black threatens to win at once by 9...Nxc3 10 bxc3 Bxc3+ followed by 11...Bxa1.
How shall White meet the threat? If he plays the natural 9 Rc1, the knight is adequately guarded since it is attacked three times and defended three times. However, Black then capitalizes on a curious fact about the power of a pinned piece: not only is it helpless to make a move but it has also lost its ability to defend! Translated into chess language, this means that 9 Rc1 can be met by 9...Qxa2, a capture startling at first glance but an obvious one if we realize that the knight’s defensive power is illusory! I stress this circumstance because it is important. Knowing it, recognizing it and applying it has caused (chess) kingdoms to topple.
All this fuss about winning a miserable a-pawn? Let’s see what would happen thereafter:
After 9 Rc1 Qxa2, Black’s method is classical in its simplicity. He follows up by ...Bxc3+ and after the recapture by the pawn exchanges queens. He has an extra pawn, but this is not enough advantage to bring about checkmate. He must increase his material superiority sufficiently to justify him in going after the king, and this can only be done by turning one of his pawns into a queen. So he selects the most likely candidate, in this case the passed a-pawn, and pushes it step by step up the board. The pawn’s advance faces the opponent with a problem that becomes more acute with every step taken by the pawn. He must head off the pawn or blockade it completely, in either case tying up one or more of his pieces to do so. The defence is under the strain of keeping the pawn under constant surveillance, while at the same time having to guard against a sudden switching of the attack toward his king. What often happens is that he either has to give up a piece for the pawn or allow further exchanges of pieces, a procedure which leads to inevitable loss.
Such long-range plans are not based on exact calculation; they represent a general idea of the method for winning in positions of this nature. </s>"

The opening itself is so strong that White can build up a promising position merely by developing his pieces so that they occupy the most suitable squares immediately. The method is simplicity itself:
Put every single piece to work, and move no piece twice until development is complete.
The fact that 3 e3 releases one bishop but shuts in another is of little moment, as the c1-bishop can get into the game by way of b2. White does not indicate his specific intentions: he might play the Colle Attack or perhaps simply develop the bishop at d3 with a view to early kingside castling. </s>"

He prefers this to the alternative pawn support by 3...e6, which confines his queen’s bishop.
However, if Black wants to free his bishop, why not move it at once to f5? There it would stand ready to oppose White’s bishop when it moves to d3. The almost inevitable bishop exchange then removes White’s attacking bishop from the board and takes the sting out of the Colle system of attack.
Another possibility was pushing on to c5 at once with his pawn, striking at White’s centre, and opening the c-file for the use of his own heavy pieces. But why play 3...c6, moving a pawn unnecessarily in the opening? Why waste time defending when nothing is threatened? </s>"

Black’s advantage consists mainly in his two pawns to one on the queenside, and this, after an exchange of pawns, can turn into one pawn against none. As for the c-file, it can be seized by the a8-rook. The rook will drive White’s queen off and remain in control of the file. </s>"

Moving the pawn to d5 loses a pawn, supporting it with 9 e3 (in order to recapture with a pawn and maintain a pawn in the centre), ties down the e-pawn to the job of defence. The chances then of the e-pawn’s ever reaching e4 are rather dubious. </s>"

1)He has exchanged a centre pawn for a less central pawn.
2)His c-pawn controls d4, making it impossible for White to settle a piece on that square.
3)His queen and a1-rook will be able to operate with good effect on the newly opened b-file. </s>"

With the departure of the queen, the f1-rook can occupy d1, exert pressure on the d-file, and make life uncomfortable for Black’s forces on that file. </s>"

This one attacks and threatens to eliminate, by 4 cxd5, Black’s centre. It does additional service in increasing the mobility (actual and potential) of White’s pieces. It clears a diagonal for the queen and assures the opening of the c-file for the later use of the queen or a1-rook. </s>"

If White tries breaking up the centre by 4 cxd5, Black is prepared to recapture with a pawn, to keep the centre intact by maintaining a pawn at d5.
Although 3...e6 has the drawback of shutting in the c8-bishop, it is still Black’s best move. The difficulty in developing the bishop effectively may not seem alarming, but if it is not overcome, it will amount to Black playing a piece short. For the present, in partial compensation, the f8-bishop has lots of elbow-room. </s>"

It clamps a pin on the knight and thereby exerts pressure on any pieces behind it. Black cannot move freely about while his kingside is gripped by the bishop.
In the 19th century, White would more often have developed the dark- squared bishop at f4, where it commands a useful diagonal. Nowadays we look for sharper, more vigorous moves. If we can mobilize our forces and at the same time restrain the enemy’s development, we accomplish more than with routine, often innocuous, measures. The pin of the knight paralyses Black’s only developed piece. </s>"

For one thing, in unpinning the knight, the bishop is restricted to a defensive, passive role. Its development has been dictated by the fact that White put pressure on the knight.
Black’s play, incidentally, is in no way to be deprecated. The bishop’s move, modest as it is, is a step forward in the process of development. The bishop has left the last rank, taken up a strong defensive post, and cleared the kingside, enabling Black to castle. </s>"

From d7, the knight supports an eventual thrust at White’s centre by the e-pawn or the c-pawn.
The knight must not develop at c6, where it blocks the c-pawn. This pawn must not be prevented from advancing to c5, where it can dispute control of the centre. </s>"

Black’s game is cramped, but alternatives aimed at freeing it immediately are not convincing:

The weakness of a pawn separated from its fellows lies not so much in the fact that the pawn can only be defended by pieces, but in the peculiar circumstance that enemy pieces can settle themselves on the square directly in front of the pawn (in this case d5) and stay there indefinitely, secure in the knowledge that no enemy pawns can drive them away.
The strength of an isolated pawn in the centre (for instance at d4, if White recaptured by 11 exd4) consists of its control of the strategically important e5- and c5-squares, its ability to spearhead an attack to break up a position, and its value as a support for an outpost – in this case a knight at e5. </s>"

Notice that White has made only those pawn moves which were necessary to release pieces, or which added to the mobility of pieces already developed. Every single move, of piece or pawn, furthered the development of White’s position and increased its potential energy. </s>"

The potential of two bishops working in harmony is not be to given up lightly, so White does not consider a move such as 14 d3 which lets Black play 14 ...Nxd3 and exchange a short-stepping knight for a long- range bishop.

Against this, Black’s move offers one objection, seemingly a slight one. The d5-square, no longer under the pawn’s control, has been weakened. It offers White the prospect of utilizing this central point for the easy manoeuvring of his pieces to any part of the board.

Where most of us think of an exchange in terms of what happens after 23 Bxe6, the great master visualizes an exchange as an opportunity to substitute another piece for one that must come off the board. White is willing to exchange, but only if he can be assured of keeping control of d5 by replacing the bishop with another piece.
Let me reword this, so that the message is unmistakable:
Supporting a piece under attack (here the bishop at d5) puts more pressure on Black, where a direct exchange or a retreat might relieve it.
Note incidentally the full effect of the queen’s magnificent centralization, and her radiation of power in so many directions:
1)The queen supports the bishop at d5.
2)The queen adds to the bishop’s attack on the b-pawn.
3)The queen helps in the attack on the e-pawn.
4)The queen threatens (indirectly) Black’s b4-bishop. </s>"

White has the superior position, but how does he break through?
Let us listen in on what Rubinstein might say to himself in reasoning out a course of action:
My rooks are as well placed as they can be and doing a good job in controlling the open d-file. My queen is strongly centralized and exerts pressure in every direction. My bishop bears down on his e-pawn and keeps a rook and knight chained to its defence. My pieces are all usefully occupied and must stay where they are.
How about my opponent? His defence just about holds together, but his pieces must stay where they are to guard his weak points. If I leave him alone, he might consolidate his forces, and even counterattack.
If I leave him alone...
Say, isn’t that the key to the position?
I must not leave him alone! I must interfere with the arrangement of his pieces. I must drive them off from their present positions. In fact, I might ruin his game by driving off even one defender!
Since my pieces are all useful where they are, I must not disturb them but look to my pawns to break up the defence. Which pawn shall I use, and which of his pieces shall I try to dislodge?
The first thing to do is to find a target. His queen and rooks are too far away and too agile to be bothered by pawns. Any of them can move off to a different square on a file or a rank and still control it. I must aim at a fixed target – some piece that is needed at the spot where it is stationed and loses its effectiveness as soon as it is displaced. How about the knight? Suppose I played 29 h4 and gave it a nudge by 30 h5? It would have to leave its fine defensive position immediately. Where could it go? If to e7, it blocks the action of the e8-rook, and if it retreats to the back rank, it is out of play for a time. Besides, I get another benefit in moving the h-pawn. It gives my king a flight square, so that he doesn’t fall into a surprise mate on the first rank. </s>"

The obvious threat is 30 h5, dislodging the knight, and then capturing the e-pawn. The ulterior purpose is to compel Black to protect the endangered pawn by 29...f6, weakening the cordon of pawns near his king. Further weaknesses may then be induced by h5 and h6, attacking the g-pawn. </s>"

Let’s take a look at some interesting possibilities then:
1)32 ...Rg8 33 h6 (threatening 34 Rd8 followed by mate at g7) 33...Nf5 34 hxg7+ Nxg7 35 Qxf6 and Black both loses a pawn and falls into a deadly pin.
2)32 ...Qb8 33 h6 gxh6 34 Qxf6+ Kg8 35 Bxe5 Ng6 36 Rd7 with a quick mate.
3)32 ...Rcc8 33 h6 gxh6 34 Bh4, threatening 35 Bxf6#. Black cannot guard against that mate by a knight move as it leaves his queen en prise.
How many of these variations did White foresee? And how many did Black know he was avoiding when he moved his knight to f8 instead of to e7?
The answer is – probably none! A good player can, almost at a glance, sense the effect of a move that is obviously decisive. He saves himself a great deal of valuable time when he does not even bother about analysing the resources of such a defence as 31 ...Ne7. The fact that it permits such a paralysing entrance into the vitals as 32 Qf7 practically rules it out from more than fleeting consideration. </s>"

White is not playing to the gallery in offering a queen sacrifice. All that he wants is to penetrate still deeper into the heart of Black’s position, and this is the simplest way to do so. The move is brilliant nevertheless, and making a move of this sort (even vicariously) gives one a thrill.
I must warn the player who likes the excitement of springing a surprise move on his opponent that it is a waste of time to look for brilliant moves in the course of a game unless the position warrants it. You must first get an advantage, however slight. Work on increasing the advantage until you have built up a position that is definitely superior. Once you have established your right to look for combinations, the brilliant moves will come of themselves.
White of course does not expect Black to take his queen and allow 34  d8+ and a quick mate. What he has in mind primarily is to secure complete control of d7, an important square for his rooks to exploit.
One of the most interesting things to me in the position is that White threatens his opponent with disaster on three ranks:
1)On the eighth rank by 34 Qxe8+ followed by mate.
2)On the seventh rank by 34 Rd7 followed by 35 hxg7#.
3)On the sixth rank by 34 hxg7+ Kxg7 35 Qxf6+, winning easily. </s>"
