Black could have captured with a piece instead, but that amounts to an eventual surrender of the centre. White would evict the piece by e4 and remain in control of all the strategically important central squares. </s>"

He intends to storm White’s citadel of pawns with his queen supported by a minor piece, for instance by 15 ...Bd6 or 15 ...Ng4. This would compel one of the pawns to leave its base and create weaknesses that Black could exploit. The advanced pawn itself might be susceptible to attack, or avenues might be opened leading to the king.
This chipping away at the foundation is an interesting process for rendering an apparently strongly fortified position vulnerable to assault. </s>"

Instead the superficially attractive 12 e4 does not accomplish much, as after 12 ...Qh5 the vital e4-square is occupied by a pawn, making it unavailable for the manoeuvring of pieces, while Black benefits in having an extra passed pawn on the d-file. </s>"

In fact, on 2 d4 exd4 3 Qxd4 Nc6 the queen must retreat and lose a move. Or if 2 e4, White remains with a backward d-pawn, while the f1-bishop cannot get to c4. </s>"

White brings a third piece into play and at the same time eases the strain on his knight.
Meanwhile he threatens 7 Nxe5, against which Black has no defence in 6...Nc6 as 7 a3 Bxc3 8 Bxc3 attacks the queen and wins the enemy pawn on e5.  </s>"
