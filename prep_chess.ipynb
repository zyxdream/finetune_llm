White anchors a pawn in the centre of the board and opens lines for his queen and a bishop. His next move, if he is allowed, will be 2 d4. The two pawns will then control four squares on the fifth rank, c5, d5, e5 and f5, and prevent Black from placing any of his pieces on those important squares.\n","How shall Black reply to White’s first move? He must not waste time considering meaningless moves, such as l ...h6 or l ...a6. These and other aimless moves do nothing toward developing the pieces, nor do they interfere with White’s threat to monopolize the centre. Black must fight for an equal share of the good squares. Black must dispute possession of the centre. Why all this stress on the centre? Why is it so important? Pieces placed in the centre enjoy the greatest freedom of action and have the widest scope for their attacking powers. A knight, for example, posted in the centre, reaches out in eight directions and attacks eight squares. Standing at the side of the board, its range of attack is limited to four squares. It is only half a knight! Occupation of the centre means control of the most valuable territory. It leaves less room for the enemy’s pieces, and makes defence difficult, as his pieces tend to get in each other’s way. Occupation of the centre, or control of it from a distance, sets up a barrier that divides the opponent’s forces and prevents them from cooperating harmoniously. Resistance by an army thus disunited is usually not very effective. </s>\n"]}],"source":["new_df = pd.DataFrame()\n","new_df['text'] = df.apply(format_template,
